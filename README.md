## $\text{Problem Statement:}$
This repository is focused on the team project associated with the coursework of Unsupervised Machine Learning. The problem that we are trying to solve through this project focuses on analyzing user interaction with YouTube trending
videos and what marks the trends apart from the most apparent factor, the channel size. We aim to utilize metrics such as the number of views per video, likes/dislikes per video, comment count, tags (content
category relevance), and the demographics of the publisher and recommend expansive strategies for YouTube content creators.

## $\text{Business Relevance:}$
YouTube isn't just cat videos anymore. With 122 million daily users, businesses are flocking to connect with customers, while creators build careers from vlogs to tutorials. But what makes videos truly go viral?
This project ditches the fluff and analyzes what gets users to "like" beyond just channel size, be it targeted ads, smarter creators, or thriving platforms. By employing machine learning tools, we aim to understand
how a business can thrive and excel on this platform and efficiently expand their customer base. We also want to propagate effective and ethical business expansion techniques that millions of
users can utilize to multiply their earnings using this platform.
